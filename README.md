<strong><u> Lab Session 04 </u></strong><strong><u>Exercise:</u></strong>

<strong><u>Question 1:</u></strong>

Obtain the state space representation for the system shown below. Solve the resulting state equations using MATLAB <em>ode45</em> function (write complete script). Plot the inductor current<em> i</em><em><sub>1</sub></em> and<em> i</em><em><sub>2</sub></em> and the capacitor voltage<em> v</em><em><sub>c</sub></em> as marked in the figure with respect to time for <em>t = 0 </em>to 5<em>00</em> sec considering the following values of <em>R</em>, <em>L</em> and <em>C</em> and write in your words about what you observed by looking at plots.

[<em><u>Hint:</u> Refer lecture 3 for the possible observations about this question.</em>]

[<em>Use separate A4 sheets for plots and attach it with this document</em>]

<u>System Parameters:</u>

R<sub>1</sub> = R<sub>2</sub>  = 10

L<sub>1</sub> = L<sub>2</sub> = 1 C = 5 e = 50
